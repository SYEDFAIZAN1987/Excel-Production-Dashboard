# Excel Production Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains an **Excel-based Production Dashboard** that provides **real-time insights into manufacturing performance, production efficiency, and operational metrics**. It is designed to help **businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)** related to production output, downtime, and efficiency.

## Features
- **Production Performance Analysis**: Track daily, weekly, and monthly production trends.
- **Efficiency Monitoring**: Identify bottlenecks, machine downtime, and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).
- **Workforce Productivity**: Analyze operator performance and shift-wise production rates.
- **Material Utilization**: Monitor raw material consumption and waste reduction strategies.
- **Automated Data Updates**: Dynamic pivot tables and charts for real-time insights.
